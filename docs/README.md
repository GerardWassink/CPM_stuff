Info about tools etc. for CP/M

### Z80Asm
At first, I was using the assembler that came with CP/M, named ASM. Later on, looking for the block transfer instructions and not able to find them, I found out that it is an 8080 assembler...

A net search led me to [Z80Asm for Windows](http://www.trs-80emulators.com/z80asm/). It is worth checking it out! The free version has a few restrictions (see the bottom of the linked page above). The paid version can produce Z80 \*.com files, that can be run on the RC2014 Z80 CP/M computer.

### Z80Disasm
Matthew also has written the freeware [Z80Disasm dis-assembler for Windows](http://www.trs-80emulators.com/z80disasm/).

###printable
As you know, printing out a web page does not necessarily lead to nice printable text. So I made versions that are (I like paper on my desk to browse through, rather than an extra window on my screen). I contacted Matthew Reed, the author of the program, and received his permission to share these files.
