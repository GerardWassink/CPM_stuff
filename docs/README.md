Info about tools etc. for CP/M

### Z80ASM
At first, I was using the assembler that came with CP/M, named ASM. Later on, looking for the block transfer instructions and not able to find them, I found out that it is an 8080 assembler...

A net search led me to [Z80Asm for Windows](http://www.trs-80emulators.com/z80disasm/). It is worth checking it out! The free version has a few restrictions (see the bottom of the linked page above). The paid version can produce Z80 \*.com files, that can be run on the RC2014 Z80 CP/M computer.
