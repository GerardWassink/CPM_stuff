### GAWGETIM
This is my first Z80 assembler program since, oh, I don't know, some odd 40 years. 
GAW are my initials and the rest means: Get Time.
The program uses HBIOS to get the time from the RTC (Real Time Clock) and BDOS to put the result out to the console.
You will find the source, an assembly listing in text- and in PDF format, and an example of the output:
