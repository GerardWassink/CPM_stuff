Info about and homegrown apps for CP/M

### GAWGETIM
This is my first Z80 assembler program since, oh, I don't know, some odd 40 years. 
GAW are my initials and the rest means: Get Time.
The program uses HBIOS to get the time from the RTC (Real Time Clock) and BDOS to put the result out to the console.
You will find the source, an assembly listing in text- and in PDF format, and an example of the output:

### GAWLOGO
This is a small program that generates the logo for my Z80 CP/M system. I called it 'Devore'. All my computers have been named after starship vessels. This one is named after the USS Devore, callsign NCC-64088, it was commanded by Captain Joshua Martin and it acted as support ship in Star Trek: Bridge Commander.

### CLS
A very small program, just to clear the screen.
